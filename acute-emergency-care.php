                            <p>Acute and Emergency (A&E) Care Centre at MasterG MediGlobe Multispecialties Hospital has
                                been in operation since 2021 and sees over 10,000 patients a year.
                            </p>
                            <p class="pt-4">The Centre has an urgent care section which receives all walk-in patients
                                (except Cardio patients as of) and an acute care area which sees the critically ill and
                                trauma.
                            </p>

                            <p class="pt-4">The Centre adopts a team approach towards the management of acute
                                resuscitation and major trauma, with the participation of in-house surgical and medical
                                specialists. This contributes to the smooth and expedient management of all ill
                                patients.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3 class="pt-4">What Is An Emergency</h3>
                        <p>The Acute & Emergency Care Centre attends to a wide variety of patients. Because the
                            resources are finite, there is a need to prioritise patients upon arrival to receive
                            emergency medical care. Acuity (or severity) would naturally form the basis for such
                            prioritisation.</p>

                        <p class="pt-4">The assessment of patient with the aim of prioritising is called Triage and this
                            is carried out by a triage nurse. After getting information about the patient's problems and
                            initial assessment of the vital signs, the triage nurse will assign a PACS (or simply, P)
                            status.</p>
